- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Charlie Hillner from Germany.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in general mathematical statistics, R programming and adaptive clinical trial designs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing my PhD in biostatistics on multiple testing in adaptive clinical trials.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email (chillner at uni-bremen.de, charliehillner8 at gmail.com)
- In this repository, I store all the R-programs I have written for my PhD-thesis on adaptive group sequential designs with population-wise error rate control.
